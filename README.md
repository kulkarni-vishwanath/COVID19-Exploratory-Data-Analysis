# COVID19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

I have tried to explore the COVID-19 cases in India in this notebook. This is the initial version of the notebook and will be updated several times during the next few days.
Please also note that since the Plotly visualizations are not supported in github, use the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kulkarni-vishwanath/COVID19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/master/Covid_EDA.ipynb) link to view the notebook. Any inputs are appreciated.
